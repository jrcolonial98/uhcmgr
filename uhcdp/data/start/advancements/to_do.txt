WIP:
Death - right now it only catches entity kills
team evil special - lava bucket kill, not properly implemented
Splat! - die to fall damage, right now it's only the description

Army of One - get three kills after the rest of your team has died
I thought we were friends! - hurt a teammate
Yes Today - shoot through a shield
An ACME Accident - anvil kill

Coward - high sneak time stat
Tougher than nails - cumulatively lose more health than possible without healing

Tricked! - drink a poison stew
Boobytrapped! - open a trapped chest (should NOT go in chat)

Ironman - be the last person to take damage
Ironteam - last team to take damage
Just the two of us! - ("We can make it if we try") down to a team of two
